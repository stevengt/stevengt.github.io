If you are getting an error similar to the one above when trying to run a Node.js app locally with Heroku, the guide [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs) gives the exact commands you should run to get it working. My problem was that I installed all the dependencies globally instead of locally.
