"<span style="color:blue">House</span> of Leaves" is my favorite book ever. If you haven't read it, one thing to know about it is that every instance of the word <span style="color:blue">house</span> is highlighted in blue. I decided it would be fun to bring this into web surfing, so I made a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/house-of-leaves-highlight/dchdopmbaeadekogdimbljfchfnhjkag) that does the same thing using jQuery's highlight function. It's a little buggy but seems to work well enough. Enjoy!
